# General
- Go deep on things. Become an expert in something. It doesn't need to be "useful", but usefulness should be something you consider
- Meet people online, have a public presence
- Read a lot
- Try to be well rounded; lean on your strengths, but also fix your flaws
- There are lots of forces pushing yourself towards paths that are laid by others. However, you should make informed decisions about what you want to do with your life
- spend time with people you want to become
