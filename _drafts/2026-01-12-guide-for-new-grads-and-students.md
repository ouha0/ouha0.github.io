- The job market has become tough for new grads, I just thought I would try my best to provide some insight and tips, which are hopefully helpful
- This guide is aimed at new grads / current students in tech, but I hope it would be helpful to everyone
- AI is making everyone's resume look quite similar to each other, and it is hard to distinguish yourself over others. Add this with the layoffs, and reduction in new hires, it makes it very hard to land your first job.
- However, on the recruiter side, they are also trouble finding candidates that are the right fit.
- It seems very bad saying this, but from sources online, from the interviewer side, they say that many candidates are horrible and don't know their stuff (interviewing without any preparation). This might be due to over-reliance on AI. Anthropic recently had a paper that mentioned that AI coding assistants significantly hinders skill development.
- Well, opportunities are rare and you should take every opportunity you have seriously. This means preparing for the interview, and doing mock interviews...
- If you ask, whats the point of this if AI can write our code for us, maybe this post isn't for u. Out of the set of possible AI development paths, if there is AGI, maybe no one needs to code. But that would be a bigger societal problem. In almost all other situations, practicing to pass this interview process is helfpul.
- There is a reason big tech imposed this type of interview process. Based on data, and scalability, they perhaps think it works best. Its hard to blame the process, if u can't propose a better process...

- The first thing to know is to figure out what types of jobs you are looking for

- Finding a job is essentially 2 steps, getting the interview and passing the interview.
- On a high level, this basically means signalling to the interviewer that you are the candidate they want, whether its in the recruiter screening process, or the technical interview.
- To get the interview, only show the good side of yourself on your resume. Don't add fluff, keep it simple < 1 page, don't add irrelevant experience. Your resume should signal to the recruiter that you are the perfect candidate for them. This most likely means that your resume should reflect the skills required on the job description you are applying to
- In terms of GPA, if you're not aiming for PHD, or grad school, there is generally no point aiming for scores higher than 85. Time could be better spent working on projects, opensource or whatever that paints a more complete picture on your resume.
- Another key part of getting the interview, is asking for a referral. This means reaching out to friends, linkedln etc... Ideally, referrals should come from genuine relationships that can vouch for you, but reaching out to strangers is perfectly fine; it is better than nothing. They were in the same position in the past. And they also get a bonus for successfully referring a candidate, so they have some incentive to help!

- The next step is passing the interview. Again, you should try signal to the interviewer that you are the perfect candidate. This means that you should know their marking criteria well. In general, you are tested on algorithms, communication, problem solving and coding ability. You will generally get a final score; strong no hire, no hire, leaning no hire, leaning hire, hire and strong hire. In these interviews, it is always important to go the direction the interviewers want you to go, and it is almost always a bad idea to ignore the hint / nudge.
- It is always better to say "I don't know" rather than speak gibberish. Some "I don't knows" is a neutral signal, lots of "I don't knows" is a negative signal, but speaking gibberish is a very negative signal.

Also, being nice and getting along with the interviewer goes a long way in these interviews.

- Some negative signals:
- coding without asking any clarifying questions. Most questions are designed to be ambiguous, and coding immediately without asking questions is almost a no hire.
- Coding without communication. Ideally, you want talk about the solution as you implement. I know its unnatural, so you should do this when you practice!
- messing up syntax. If you're nervous and you mess up syntax, its not that bad as long as you recover from it. It's very bad when it signals that you are very unfamiliar with your language of choice
- not dry running test cases. Testing is a very important part of the engineering process, do it without the interviewer asking. This means choosing your own inputs, considering the expected output, and going through the code LINE BY LINE
- not knowing basic language methods. If you forgot how to create a hashmap, and check whether a key exists, this is a very negative signal.

The tech interview is generally knowledge based, leetcode based, or both.

- Generally, I feel that leetcode hards in interviews are quite rare (perhaps quant firms are different), and in the unlucky circumstance that you get it, they generally don't expect you to zoom through it perfectly like an easy question.

- Ask the interviewer insightful / interesting questions about the company at the end of the interview. If you ask nothing, its like saying im not really interested in working at your company...

# A note on LLMS

- Using llms for learning makes it easy to fool yourself into thinking that you already know something. You think you know it but you actually don't
- Good rule of thumb is being able to write the high level idea of the solution, why it works. Also be able to write every line of code, and knowing
the importance of every line of code
- "if you think you know something and don't write it down, you only think you know it" - Leslie Lamport

Overall tips:

- Remember that in the finding a job is a numbers game. You want to maximize your probability of getting a job and passing an interview. And when you apply to enough jobs, and get enough interviews, you will eventually land a job. Believe in yourself :)
- If something doesn't work, try something new. i.e. if your resume isn't getting you resumes, do more projects, fix ur resume, get referrals. Don't apply to future jobs with the same resume...
- Try to understand what the employer wants and work backwards
- Always follow the lead of the recruiter. If the recruiter wants to explore a particular aspect of a problem, go that path. If they ask u a question, answer the question directly. If they mention anything about time, speed up...

# Resources

- There are lots of resources on youtube. And recruiters from big tech companies will typically give you resources! It is very important to study the recruiter resources.
- This blog is very high level, and doesn't necessarily apply to specific companies
- Neetcode
- A life Engineered (Stave), etc...
