# High Level Plan
- Intro -> Getting a job is essentially two steps; getting the interview and then passing the interview
- On a high level, one should direct their effort towards increasing the probability of getting the interview, and passing the interview
- When you apply for a job, you should think backwards. What is the recruiter looking for (try to understand via the job description and ask chatgpt)

- To achieve this, you should signal to the company of interest that you are the perfect candidate / the candidate they are looking for.
- Getting the interview: Talk about resumes, applying early, applying with referrals (networking), school careers events (this im not too familiar with)
- Resumes: if you're goal is finding a job, don't put too much emphasis on university results. off course, it must be decent, but realistically, only
masters / phd programs care about stellar results. It is better to demonstrate in your resume as a well-rounded person; i.e. internship experience,
research experience, open source contribution, personal projects. Resumes should be short, clear and concise. Resumes for juniors should almost always be
1 page. Just imagine your recruiter has 1000 resumes(which is reasonable). The recruiters probably take < 10 seconds(more if they think it is reasonable) on each one and this already means
that they will probably focus 3 hours to go through that pile.
This probably means they are looking at your uni, your results if they are good, any impactful project, and any big tech internship. Your resume
ideally should catch the eye of the recruiter in 10 seconds

- Passing the interview: Different types of interviews; pure behavioural, project discussion, leetcode, programming language discussion,
systems design (I don't have that much experience here) and more

- Remember at the end of the day, job applications is a numbers game. The more you apply, the more you are expected to find a job
- Throughout the whole interview process: Your goal is to try give positive signals and avoid giving negative ones
- some list of positive signals: being friendly and nice to interviewers, recruiters, answering the question clearly and communicating thoughts well,
understand tradeoffs of the solution, open to feedback from the recruiter, follows the lead of the interview when they hint a particular direction,
don't lie
- avoid negative signals: bombing the interview, arrogant, fail to give a working solution, doens't understand hints from interviews, not communicating
, cheating, being racist / disrespectful, saying you know something when you actually don't and the interviewer finds out, disrespectful to recruiter,
having a list of requirements for the job/recruiter at the offer stage (i.e. I only want to do backend, I want to work fully remote; some requirements
are fine, but having too many is negative, and may get your offer rescinded, though unlikely)

## Other
- On learning: when you learn through AI, it is easy to think that you know something when you actually don't
- For example; i read the solution chatgpt showed me and i think i understand, I can write the solution from scratch, I can write the solution from scratch
and I understand the importance of each line of code (and why it would break without it) and I can discuss the tradeoffs. I personally think
most questions I encountered are easy-medium difficulty, with hard followups if you ever get there

## Tips
- Get the paid version of chatgpt, gemini, or claude. It is worth it and use the strongest model... You are a leetcode expert and has extensive experience as a Interviewer
You will help me prepare for my upcoming interview. Give me feedback on correctness, coding style and tradeoffs. Give me minimal hints only when i need it
that help with my learning....
- Give some context in every chat window, remember to start a new chat when the chat gets too long. Also, beware that solutions, especially to relatively
niche problems on leetcode can be wrong. If you keep getting wrong answers, it probably means that you should start a new chat window




- The junior tech market has become tough. I will try to provide some insight and tips, that are hopefully helfpul
- This guide is aimed at new grads / current students in tech, though the high level idea may apply to job search in general
- A sidenote here; Ideally, it would make your time easier if you get a job via your internship
- AI is making everyone's resume look quite similar to each other, and it is hard to distinguish yourself over others. Add this with the layoffs, and reduction in new hires, it makes it very hard to land your first job.
- However, on the recruiter side, they are also trouble finding candidates that are the right fit.
- It seems very bad saying this, but from sources online, from the interviewer side, they say that many candidates are horrible and don't know their stuff (interviewing without any preparation). This might be due to over-reliance on AI. Anthropic recently had a paper that mentioned that AI coding assistants significantly hinders skill development.
- Well, opportunities are rare and you should take every opportunity you have seriously. This means preparing for the interview, and doing mock interviews...
- If you ask, whats the point of this if AI can write our code for us, maybe this post isn't for u. Out of the set of possible AI development paths, if there is AGI, maybe no one needs to code. But that would be a bigger societal problem. In almost all other situations, practicing to pass this interview process is helfpul.
- There is a reason big tech imposed this type of interview process. Based on data, and scalability, they perhaps think it works best. Its hard to blame the process, if u can't propose a better process...

- The first thing to know is to figure out what types of jobs you are looking for

- Finding a job is essentially 2 steps, getting the interview and passing the interview.
- On a high level, this basically means signalling to the interviewer that you are the candidate they want, whether its in the recruiter screening process, or the technical interview.
- To get the interview, only show the good side of yourself on your resume. Don't add fluff, keep it simple < 1 page, don't add irrelevant experience. Your resume should signal to the recruiter that you are the perfect candidate for them. This most likely means that your resume should reflect the skills required on the job description you are applying to
- In terms of GPA, if you're not aiming for PHD, or grad school, there is generally no point aiming for scores higher than 85. Time could be better spent working on projects, opensource or whatever that paints a more complete picture on your resume.
- Another key part of getting the interview, is asking for a referral. This means reaching out to friends, linkedln etc... Ideally, referrals should come from genuine relationships that can vouch for you, but reaching out to strangers is perfectly fine; it is better than nothing. They were in the same position in the past. And they also get a bonus for successfully referring a candidate, so they have some incentive to help!
- cold reachouts almost always works if you are nice and able to demonstrate you are high potential

- The next step is passing the interview. Again, you should try signal to the interviewer that you are the perfect candidate. This means that you should know their marking criteria well. In general, you are tested on algorithms, communication, problem solving and coding ability. You will generally get a final score; strong no hire, no hire, leaning no hire, leaning hire, hire and strong hire. In these interviews, it is always important to go the direction the interviewers want you to go, and it is almost always a bad idea to ignore the hint / nudge.
- It is always better to say "I don't know" rather than speak gibberish. Some "I don't knows" is a neutral signal, lots of "I don't knows" is a negative signal, but speaking gibberish is a very negative signal.

Also, being nice and getting along with the interviewer goes a long way in these interviews.

- Some negative signals:
- Showing up to the interview too early, not showing up on time
- hard to work with
- coding without asking any clarifying questions. Most questions are designed to be ambiguous, and coding immediately without asking questions is almost a no hire.
- Coding without communication. Ideally, you want talk about the solution as you implement. I know its unnatural, so you should do this when you practice!
- messing up syntax. If you're nervous and you mess up syntax, its not that bad as long as you recover from it. It's very bad when it signals that you are very unfamiliar with your language of choice
- not dry running test cases. Testing is a very important part of the engineering process, do it without the interviewer asking. This means choosing your own inputs, considering the expected output, and going through the code LINE BY LINE
- not knowing basic language methods. If you forgot how to create a hashmap, and check whether a key exists, this is a very negative signal.

The tech interview is generally knowledge based, leetcode based, or both.

- Generally, I feel that leetcode hards in interviews on average are quite rare (perhaps quant firms are different), and in the unlucky circumstance that you get it, they generally don't expect you to zoom through it perfectly like an easy question.
- Ask the interviewer insightful / interesting questions about the company at the end of the interview. If you ask nothing, its like saying im not really interested in working at your company...

# A note on LLMS

- Using llms for learning makes it easy to fool yourself into thinking that you already know something. You think you know it but you actually don't
- Good rule of thumb is being able to write the high level idea of the solution, why it works. Also be able to write every line of code, and knowing
the importance of every line of code
- "if you think you know something and don't write it down, you only think you know it" - Leslie Lamport

Overall tips:

- Remember that in the finding a job is a numbers game. You want to maximize your probability of getting a job and passing an interview. And when you apply to enough jobs, and get enough interviews, you will eventually land a job. Believe in yourself :)
- If something doesn't work, try something new. i.e. if your resume isn't getting you resumes, do more projects, fix ur resume, get referrals. Don't apply to future jobs with the same resume...
- Try to understand what the employer wants and work backwards
- Always follow the lead of the interviewer. If the interviewer wants to explore a particular aspect of a problem, it probably meanas they have prepared questions
on that path; follow their lead. If they ask u a question, answer the question directly. If they mention anything about time, speed up...

# Sidenote:
- Don't get too emotionally invested in any particular company. Just keep applying and interviewing.
- Sometimes you may think you didn't do well, but whether you are H/SH depends on the list of positive signals they receieved. The bar is
different at every company off course. Obviously, some signals like failing to have a working solution for a leetcode easy

# Resources
- There are lots of resources on youtube. And recruiters from big tech companies will typically give you resources! It is very important to study the recruiter resources.
- This blog is very high level, and doesn't necessarily apply to specific companies
- Neetcode for leetcode
- A life Engineered (Stave), etc...


# Introduction
The junior tech market is brutal. Macroeconomic shifts have reduced entry-level roles, while the
candidate supply swells with new graduates and laid-off veterans. Worse, Large Language Models have homogenized applications
and raised the baseline for everyone; incompetant, average, and competent engineers all look competent, the great engineers are still great off course.
Because candidates feed identical job descriptions into the same AI prompts,
a recruiter sees a thousand clones. Candidates who look great in paper often disappoint in person,
arriving to interviews entirely unprepared.

Do not waste energy debating whether AI will replace coders, or complaining that the interview process
broken. If AI automates everything, society will face much larger macroeconomic problems. Until then,
companies still need capable engineers, and they rely on standardized interviews to find them. Big Tech
uses this process because, at scale, there doesn't seem to be another better process. Learn the rules,
and play the game well.

Securing a job requires two steps: get the interview, and pass the interview.

To succeed, work backward. Identify your target role and dissect the job description to extract
the exact technical and behavioral signals the employer wants - whether that is AI competency,
AWS experience or C++ proficiency. Your resume must show these signals within ten seconds of skimming
it will likely be rejected. From the initial screening to the final offer negotiation, every interaction
must prove you are the candidate they need.


# (some number) The LLM Trap: The Illusion of Competance
Using Large Language Models without care creates a dangerous illusion of competance in technical interviews.
Anthropic's paper "How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills" explores this.
You prompt a model, it outputs an elegant, optimized solution, you read it, you agree. You feel as though
you have learned. You have not. Reading coding is passive; writing code is active.

> Leslie Lamport - "If you think you know something and don't write it down, you only think you know it"

In the context of learning, but technical interviews specifically, surface level understanding just
isn't sufficient under pressure. If you cannot implement the solution from scratch, articulate the time
and memory tradeoffs, and justify the point of every single line of code, you do not know the solution.
When interviewers probe your logic or introduce new constraints to the problem, the gaps in your understanding
will become very obvious.

Large Language Models can be used to help learning though.

Invest in a premium tier of a frontier model. When tackling complex problems, open a new chat /
fresh context window to prevent the model from hallucinating.
One should actively try to break down problems, and only ask LLMs when a particular sub-problem is confusing, try to break it down further, and repeat.
The more you think, the more you learn - whether doing so by asking follow-up questions, requesting
explanations. Most importantly, avoid asking the model for the answer. Ask it to be your interviewer, and give minimal hints

Provide the model with prompts / contexts, for example:

>[Persona]
>You are a distinguished Principal Engineer and an expert technical interviewer at a top-tier tech company. You have conducted hundreds of algorithmic and systems design interviews.
>
>[Task]
>Help me prepare for my upcoming software engineering interviews. I will provide you with a problem statement and my code. You must evaluate my solution and provide feedback, but you must NOT write the solution for me.
>
>[Context]
>I am a junior engineer preparing for technically rigorous interviews. I need to deeply understand the mechanics, tradeoffs, and edge cases of my code. I tend to fall into the trap of thinking I understand a solution just by reading it, so you must test my actual comprehension.
>
>[Constraints]
>1. Never provide the full correct code unless I explicitly type: "Show me the solution."
>2. Give feedback strictly on: Correctness, Time/Space Complexity, and Coding Style.
>3. If my logic is flawed, provide the absolute minimum hint required to unblock me. Formulate the hint as a question that forces me to think.
>4. If my code is correct, ask me a hard follow-up question (e.g., "How would this scale if the input data could not fit into memory?").
